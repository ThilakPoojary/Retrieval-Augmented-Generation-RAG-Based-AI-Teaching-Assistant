I'm ready to help. You've provided a list of video chunks with their corresponding timestamps and texts.

To get started, I'll summarize what we know so far:

* The user is teaching about AI.
* The student asked questions related to video chunks.
* We have three identical chunks:
 + Chunk ID: 7207
 + Text: "fans of AI"
* Timestamps for each chunk: same as the first one, 1855.0-1857.0

So far, we've covered a total of 3 seconds of content in video chunk #7207.

What's the user's next question?
